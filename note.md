## 📦 NPM Packages: Dev vs Normal Dependencies

There are two main types of packages we can install:

### 1. **Dev Dependencies**
- These are used **only during development** (e.g., testing tools, bundlers like Parcel, linters).
- Installed using:
  ```bash
  npm install <package-name> --save-dev
  ```
- Not included in the production build.

### 2. **Normal Dependencies**
- These are needed **in production** (e.g., `react`, `react-dom`).
- Installed using:
  ```bash
  npm install <package-name>
  ```

## 🎯 Version Prefixes in `package.json`

- **Caret (`^`)**: Updates to **minor** and **patch** versions.
  - Example: `"^2.15.0"` → could install `2.16.0`, `2.15.5`, etc.
- **Tilde (`~`)**: Updates to **patch** versions only.
  - Example: `"~2.15.0"` → could install `2.15.1`, `2.15.5`, but **not** `2.16.0`.

🚫 Updating to major versions automatically can **break your app**, so it’s safer to lock minor/patch updates.

---

## 🛠 `package.json` and `node_modules`

- `package.json` is the **configuration file** for your project dependencies.
- `node_modules/` contains all installed dependencies.
- You **don’t push `node_modules/` to GitHub** because:
  - It's huge.
  - It can be **regenerated** using:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  - Instead, you should push:
    - `package.json`
    - `package-lock.json`

---

## 🔁 Transitive Dependencies

- Your project depends on Parcel.
- Parcel depends on other packages.
- Those packages might also depend on others.
- This **chain of dependencies** is called **transitive dependencies**.

---

## 📁 `package-lock.json`

- This file **locks the exact versions** of all your dependencies and their transitive dependencies.
- Ensures your app behaves the **same across machines**.
- Should always be **pushed to Git**.

---

## ⚙️ npm vs npx

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm`  | Runs **npm commands** (e.g., install packages). |
| `npx`  | Executes **any package** (without installing it globally). |

Example:
```bash
npx parcel index.html
```

## 🚫 Why Not Use CDN Links?

- **CDNs** can work for quick demos.
- But they’re **not preferred** for real projects because:
  - You lose control over versions.
  - Hard to manage dependencies.
  - No bundling or optimization.

---

✅ **Best Practice**: Use `npm` to install React and other libraries locally.

```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

# ❓ Why is your app so fast and optimized?

Thanks to **Parcel**, our app is highly optimized for both development and production. Here’s how Parcel contributes to the speed and efficiency:

---

## 🚀 Development Superpowers

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**  
  Instantly updates changes without reloading the full page, making development super smooth and fast.

- **Local Dev Server**  
  Comes with a fast, built-in development server that supports HTTPS and live reload.

- **File Watching Algorithm (C++)**  
  Parcel's super-efficient C++-based file watcher ensures fast rebuilds by detecting file changes instantly.

---

## ⚡ Build Optimizations for Production

- **Caching**  
  Parcel caches previous builds, speeding up rebuilds dramatically.

- **Image Optimization**  
  Automatically compresses images without losing quality for faster load times.

- **Minification & Compression**  
  Reduces file sizes by removing unnecessary characters and compressing files.

- **Tree Shaking**  
  Eliminates unused code, so only the essential parts are shipped.

- **Bundling & Code Splitting**  
  Combines code smartly and loads only what’s needed, improving initial load performance.

- **Consistent Hashing**  
  Ensures stable file names for better long-term caching in browsers.

- **Differential Bundling**  
  Creates modern bundles for new browsers and fallback bundles for older ones—maximizing compatibility and performance.

---

## 🧪 Environment-Specific Bundles

- Parcel automatically generates separate **development** and **production** bundles with different levels of optimization, making it faster to develop and cleaner to deploy.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**  
The combination of **smart caching**, **code splitting**, **image & code optimizations**, and **instant updates** makes our app **blazingly fast**, both in development and production.

## React Elements and JSX

- At the end of the day, **React elements are just JavaScript objects**.
- To make element creation easier, Facebook developers introduced **JSX**.

### What is JSX?

- **JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that **looks like HTML or XML**.
- JSX makes a developer's life easier by making the code **more readable and expressive**.
- **JSX is not HTML inside JavaScript** — it's **HTML-like syntax** that gets **transpiled** (converted) to JavaScript before it runs in the browser.
- The transpilation is handled by tools like **Parcel and Babel**.

### JSX vs React

- **JSX and React are not the same**:
  - React is a library.
  - JSX is a syntax used with React to describe UI structure.
- JSX is ultimately **converted into React element objects**, which React uses to render the UI.

### Attributes in JSX

- JSX uses **camelCase** for attributes (e.g., `className` instead of `class`, `onClick` instead of `onclick`).

---

## React Components

### Types of Components

1. **Class-based Components** (Old Way)
2. **Functional Components** (New and Preferred Way)

- A **functional component** is just a function that **returns JSX or a React element**.

```js
function MyComponent() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}
```

---

## What Makes React Code Readable?

- **JSX is what makes your React code readable**.
- It allows you to write UI code in a way that closely resembles HTML, which is familiar and intuitive.
